Play the notes on the screen with your instrument.

First, allow microphone access. This will make a random sequence of 8 notes appear on the grand staff.

Program will automatically use your microphone to determine whether you are playing the correct note: if you are, the note will light up green.

Once a note lights up you may continue and play the next note.

Once every note is played a new random sequence of 8 notes is generated. Rinse and repeat. Read and play the notes as fast as you can!
