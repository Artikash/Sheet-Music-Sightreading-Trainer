Play the notes on the screen with your instrument.

First, allow microphone access. This will make a random sequence of 8 notes appear on the grand staff.

Website will automatically use your microphone to determine whether you are playing the correct note: once you do, the note will dissapear. You may then continue and play the next note.

If you check "limited time to play notes" and don't play the notes in time, they will turn red. You should continue to the next note once this happens.

Once every note is played (or the bar reaches the end) a new random sequence of 8 notes is generated. Rinse and repeat. Read and play the notes as fast as you can!

Thanks to Jonathan Bergknoff for the algorithm that converts microphone input to notes!
