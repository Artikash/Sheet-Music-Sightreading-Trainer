Play the notes on the screen with your instrument.

First, allow microphone access. Once calibrated, select a song and press play. You should then start playing the notes on your instrument as the bar passes over them.

If you wish to change which notes will be randomly generated, please drag the sliders above. Check or uncheck the boxes above if you want or don't want sharps and whole notes

Website will automatically use your microphone to determine whether you are playing the correct note: once you do, the note will dissapear. You may then continue and play the next note.

If you don't play the notes while the bar passes over them, they will turn red. You should continue to the next note once this happens.

Once the bar reaches the end (or every note is played if disabled) a new random sequence of notes is generated. Rinse and repeat. Read and play the notes as fast as you can!
